<h1>Dystopian Wars campaign concept</h1>

<h2 id="Overview">Overview</h2>
<p>
    This is a living rule document for the Dystopian War Campaign. The concept is summarized as follows:
    <ol>
        <li>Each player controls territories and attempts to conquer more territories by fighting other players</li>
        <li>Each player controls two persistent fleets where he/she will manage repairs, unit availability and other properties</li>
        <li>By upgrading territories and applying territory bonuses the land will feel more alive, and certain territories will earn bloody reputations</li>
    </ol>
</p>
<h2 id="VictoryConditions">Victory Conditions</h2>
<h2 id="Map">The Map</h2>
<p>
    Territories give requisition points.
    Requisition points can be spent on upgrades.
    Each territory has a fixed terrain layout. This is known as the Operational Theatre Map.
    When playing a match, players are expected to match the layout on the Operational Theatre Map as closely as possible within reason.
    Deployment zones and strategic/operational advantage are determined as normal, with the option to modify certain aspects by spending RP as detailed in <a href="#WagingWar">Waging War</a>.
    <br /><strong>*Designer's note: are deployment zones decided by owner of terrain?</strong><br />
    Territories are said to be connected when they have one shared border. Note that merely having a shared corner is not enough, so players cannot move into territories diagonally.
</p>
<h2 id="CampaignTurn">Campaign Turn</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Receive RP.</li>
    <li>Upgrade territories and declare attacks.</li>
    <li>Resolve conflicts.</li>
    <li>Manage fleets.</li>
    <li>Resolve map updates.</li>
</ol>
<p>
    A campaign turn is divided into five phases concerning management.
</p>
<h3>Receive RP</h3>
<p>
    At the beginning of a campaign turn every player receives RP according to the territories owned modified by upgrades and bonuses. For instance, a player who owns four territories of which one is a capital and one is a town will receive 30 RP for territories, 30 RP for owning a capital territory and 10 RP for owning a town for a total of 70RP.
</p>
<h3>Upgrade Territories and declare attacks</h3>
<p>
    During this phase each player allocates part of his RP budget to territory upgrades and attacks. Note that RP does not carry over to the next turn but that you'll want to reserve some RP for repairs at the end of turn.
    <br /><strong>*Designers note: We don't want RP to carry over, do we?</strong>
</p>
<h3>Resolve conflicts</h3>
<p>
    Once the declaration phase has ended, either the website or the website manager will notify all players if there are any conflicts to resolve. Included will be both offensive modifiers and defensive upgrades as well as an up-to-date Operational Theatre Map.
    <br /><strong>*Designer's note: This will be automated eventually.</strong>
</p>
<h3>Manage Fleets</h3>
<p>
    After conflicts have been resolved, players may lick their wounds and spend RP to expedite repairs on their fleets. Destroyed vessels may be restored and new vessels may be purchased for use in subsequent turns.
</p>
<h3>Resolve map updates</h3>
<p>
    Once all previous phases have been resolved, the map is updated. Territories change owner if necessary and fortifications that were bought in the previous phases are built so that their effects can be felt in subsequent turns. Once all actions for this phase have been resolved, the turn finishes and the next turn may begin.
</p>
<h2 id="Territories">Territories</h2>
<p>
    By default a territory gives +10 RP per turn. A capital territory gives +30 RP per turn. A player starts with one capital territory and two normal territories, thus has 50 RP to spend in his first turn.
</p>
<h3 id="TerritoryUpgrades">Territory upgrades</h3>
All territory upgrades must be represented by appropriate scenery and/or tokens. Each upgrade may be placed only once per territory. Unless noted otherwise, the upgrade must be marked on the Operational Theatre Map and must always start the game in the same location in so far as available scenery allows. Remember, it's better to have it look cool and make for exciting battles than to provide a teeny edge to one of the players!

Some territories provide inherent bonuses. If appropriate, these should be represented by appropriate scenery and/or tokens. Remember, it's better to have it look cool and make for exciting battles than to provide a teeny edge to one of the players!

    Players may attack territories adjacent to their own. Attacks cost requisition. There are different types of attacks:

</p>
<h2 id="#FleetManagement">Fleet Management</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
    Each player has two sets of fleet lists. One of these is the Home Fleet and the other is the Assault Fleet.
    These lists contain the units from which all other army lists are drawn.
    The Home Fleet is used for defensive army lists and the Assault fleet is used for offensive army lists.
    During a turn a unit on the army list may normally only be used once.
    This means that it may be possible that no valid army list can be made!
    Players are expected to create valid army lists whenever possible, and in cases where this is not possible they should make it as close to valid as they possibly can.
    If an invalid list is to be used, the opposing player should be informed and should approve the list to ensure that this approach is not abused (e.g., no lists where 80% of the list consists of dreadnoughts).
    When a defending player does not have sufficient points available to create a defensive list, he or she should draw units from the Assault fleet to create a valid army list.
    If all these steps have been taken and the defending player still does not have sufficient units available to defend, the defending player probably isn't long for this campaign anyway.

<h2 id="AttackBonuses">Attack Bonuses</h2>

    Players may spend RP to gain advantages when -attacking- territories. This is especially useful for sieges and forays into heavily defended areas.

    <h2 id="Alliances">Alliances</h2>
    <p>
        Players start out as part of one of three governing alliances: the Grand Coalition, the Imperial Bond and the Free Nations. Default allegiances are used, e.g. Prussian players start in the Imperial Bond and FSA players start in the Grand Coalition. Default alliance rules as detailed in the rulebook are in effect, with the following adjustments.
        Players may only include allied detachments that consist of nations that are not actively participating in the campaign (e.g. the French Republic can take allies from the Ottoman Empire). If a player wishes to include detachments from a nation that is active in this campaign, both players must be part of the same alliance. Furthermore, permission to use the allied detachment must be granted by the allied nation.
